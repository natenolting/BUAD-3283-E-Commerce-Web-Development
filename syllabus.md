### February 6th

#### Discussion

##### Review Request methods

##### Intro to PHP Sessions

* [What is a PHP Session?](http://php.net/manual/en/session.examples.basic.php)
  * Sessions are a simple way to store data for individual users against a unique session ID. <sup>[ref](http://php.net/manual/en/session.examples.basic.php)</sup>
  * Started up with the `session_start()` function.
    * A cookie is written to users browser cookies with the session id tied to the user session.
    * No output headers can be sent before `session_start()` or the `Warning: session_start(): Cannot send xyz - headers already sent` will be thrown.
  * Unlike requests like `GET` and `POST` Sessions give a mechanism to have access to user variables over multiple pages.  
  * Gives access to variables set to the `$_SESSION` global on next request
  * Sessions normally shutdown automatically when PHP is finished executing a script, but can be manually shutdown using the `session_write_close()` function. <sup>[ref](http://php.net/manual/en/session.examples.basic.php)</sup>
* Why would we need session for E-Commerce Web Development?
  * Adding items to a customers shopping carts
  * Saving a customer login to store account
  * Personalizing a customer's experience on a site (logged in customer vs guest)
* Special security concerns with sessions
  * [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Cross-Site_Request_Forgery_(CSRF))
  * [Session hijacking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Session_hijacking)

### February 8th

#### Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)

##### [What is CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

* Instructions to a browser on how to "paint" the output HTML to the screen
* Can be included in three ways: linked to a `.css` file defined in the `head` tag inside a `style` tag, or inlined on a element with a `style` attribute.
  * Styles in the `head` override styles in a linked `.css` file, styles inlined in a `style` attribute will override styles in the head and linked styles.
  * Linked or `head` styles are accessed through the `class` attribute on any html element.
* A css file can be a `.php` file if the header `header("Content-type: text/css; charset: UTF-8");`  is added to the `,php` file. <sup>[ref](https://css-tricks.com/css-variables-with-php/)</sup>

##### Basic CSS Style Declarations

###### Declaring for an element:

```css
p {
  font-size: 12px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-weight: normal;
}
```

###### Declaring as a class:

```css
.paragraph {
  font-size: 12px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-weight: normal;
  color: #000;
}
```

###### Declaring as an id:

```css
#paragraph {
  font-size: 12px;
  font-family: sans-serif;
  font-weight: normal;
}
```
**Note:** [Declaring css on an id is very difficult to override.](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/override-class-declarations-by-styling-id-attributes) It's generally bad practice to apply css to an id unless absolutely necessary.

###### Declaring as a pseudo class:

```css
.paragraph:hover {
  /** Hovering over this element will change its color  **/
  color: #ccc;
}
```
