## Midterm and Final

The midterm will be a final project proposal due at a date to be assigned by the instructor.  The final examination will be the completion and presentation of the project that is defined in your midterm proposal. The final project will be expected to implement elements discussed throughout the semester. This means it is **VERY IMPORTANT** to keep up with what is required for the project, and not wait until the last minute to try to do everything. This is your warning.

### Note
The professor reserves the right to offer unannounced quizzes and assignments, and/or activities at any time.
