#### [Payment Gateways](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_gateway)

> A payment gateway is a merchant service provided by an e-commerce application service provider that authorizes credit card or direct payments processing for e-businesses, online retailers, bricks and clicks, or traditional brick and mortar.[1] The payment gateway may be provided by a bank to its customers, but can be provided by a specialised financial service provider as a separate service, such as a payment service provider.
<br><br>A payment gateway facilitates a payment transaction by the transfer of information between a payment portal (such as a website, mobile phone or interactive voice response service) and the front end processor or acquiring bank. <sup>[ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_gateway)</sup>

* Payment Gateways are used for making online and offline transactions.
* Processing credit cards handled through gateway to a [Merchant Account](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchant_account).
* Should be connected over HTTPS.
* Can be processed via card present or card not present.
  * Card not present may have restrictions on transaction amount.
